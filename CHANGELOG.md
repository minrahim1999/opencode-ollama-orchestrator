# Changelog

All notable changes follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.9] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- **Per-agent model resolution** — `delegate-task` tool now reads each agent's `model` from `opencode.json` and passes it explicitly to `session.create()`. Previously, subagent sessions silently inherited the parent (strategist) model or fell back to the global default, ignoring per-agent model assignments.
  - Agent-level model (e.g., `agent.engineer.model`) is used when set.
  - Falls back to global `model` when agent-level is absent.
  - Logs resolved model to stderr: `[opencode-orchestrator] Delegating to {role} with model {provider}/{modelID}`.

### Added
- **Test coverage** — `test/delegate-task.test.ts` (6 tests) covering model resolution, fallback, multi-slash model IDs, and parent session passthrough.

## [2.1.8] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- README updated with full guide: quick start, configuration reference, architecture diagram, troubleshooting, testing, changelog.

## [2.1.7] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **131 tests** via Vitest covering all core modules: config-handler, event-handler, provider-lock, todo-parser, dox, constants, paths.
- Test directory (`test/`) and `vitest.config.ts` now shipped in the npm tarball so consumers can run tests.

### Fixed
- package.json: updated description to "provider-agnostic"; removed "ollama-only" keywords.

## [2.1.6] - 2026-06-17

### Changed
- **Provider lock removed** — Plugin no longer hard-locks to Ollama. Uses whatever model/provider is configured in `opencode.json`. If no model is set, falls back to the current active model. The plugin is now provider-agnostic.
- **All "Ollama" references removed** — Agent prompts, DOX templates, config descriptions, and log prefixes updated from "Ollama Orchestrator" → "Multi-Agent Orchestrator" / "opencode-orchestrator".

### Internal
- `lockProviderToOllama()` is now a no-op that logs configured models but never throws. Kept for backward compat with external callers.
- `chat.params` hook no longer blocks non-Ollama models; instead logs the resolved model for diagnostics.
- `src/types.ts` JSDoc updated: model field no longer says "MUST start with ollama/".

## [2.1.5] - 2026-06-17

### Improved
- **Regex robustness** — `looksLikeTaskRequest()` rewritten with clear reject vs accept signals. Rejects: "explain", "what is", "how does", "cancel", "nevermind", "thanks", "ok", "don't" + weak-only signals without strong keywords. Accepts: strong task verbs ("build", "create", "implement", "fix", etc.) + compound signals ("please help me build X"). Also rejects meta prefixes (`@`, `/`, `opencode`, `hermes`).
- **Config validation** — `config-handler.ts` now validates `config.plugin` is an array before calling `.find()`, validates `pluginOpts` is an object (not null/array), and type-checks numeric fields (`maxRetries`, `maxParallelWorkers`, `maxSubagentDepth`) to prevent runtime crashes from malformed `opencode.json`.
- **Atomic state writes** — `saveMissionState()` now writes to `.tmp` then `renameSync()` to target, preventing half-written `state.json` on crashes.
- **Robust mission ID parsing** — `parseMissionTimestamp()` helper parses the last dash-separated segment of `missionId` instead of hardcoded `[1]`, handling custom ID formats safely.

## [2.1.4] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed (5 critical bugs from full audit)
- **Phase gate bypassed** — Inverted condition (`!prevPhaseGate`) let missions skip phase gates even when incomplete. Fixed gate detection to properly check both incomplete and completed gates.
- **Session never tracked** — `createSession()` didn't add sessions to `deps.sessions`, so `pollSession()` returned instantly (no wait). Now tracks all sessions properly.
- **Audit results ignored** — `runAudit()` had no return value; critical-path tasks always marked as completed regardless of audit failure. Now returns `boolean`, fails the task on audit failure, and triggers retry if retries remain.
- **Dead-locked missions never fail** — Pending tasks with all-failed dependencies kept the mission alive forever. Now counts dependency-blocked pending tasks as "failed" for mission state resolution.
- **resume() missing DOX closeout** — Resumed missions never archived DOX runs or cleaned up the `missions` map. Now mirrors `start()` finalization: DOX closeout + `missions.delete()`.
- **Event handler crash** — Unwrapped `controller.start()` could crash the plugin host. Now wrapped in `try/catch`.
- **abort() no persistence** — Aborted state lost on restart. Now calls `saveMissionState()`.
- **pollSession blind** — Only polled local session map, never used SDK `session.status()`. Now tries SDK API first, falls back to local map.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- **Plugin init hang** — `lockProviderToOllama()` called `client.config.get()` during plugin initialization, which blocks indefinitely when the SDK client isn't fully ready. Now reads agent models directly from the config file instead of via SDK call.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Phase Gates** — Multi-phase missions can pause between phases for user review. Architect marks tasks with `phase-gate: yes` to trigger gates.
- **Mission HOLD state** — New state `hold` that pauses execution between phases. Strategist asks user for continuation.
- **Phase Gate Protocol** — On `yes` → resume next phase. On `no` → stay in hold. On change requests → Specialist replans remaining phases.
- **Phase-aware todo parser** — Extracts `phase` name from `## Phase N: Name` headers and `phaseGate` flag from todo metadata.
- **Gate message persistence** — Phase gate messages written to `.opencode/plans/{slug}/gate-message.txt` for Strategist to present to user after compaction.
- **Strategist prompt updated** — Steps 9-12 detail phase gate handling. Rules instruct to never skip gates.
- **Architect prompt updated** — Phase Gate Rules section instructs when and how to place `phase-gate: yes`.
- **Event handler** — `yes` and `no` are no longer ignored as casual chat, so they can trigger gate responses.

### Changed
- **MissionController.executeTodos** — Tracks `currentPhase`. Detects phase transitions and checks for completed gates before continuing.
- **MissionController.resume** — Now includes `hold` state in resumable states.
- **Todo parser regex** — Updated to capture `phase-gate: yes/no` in addition to `critical-path: yes/no`.
- **Todo parser phase extraction** — Parses `## Phase N: Name` headers and assigns phase names to todos.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Clarification Gate** — Strategist now asks 1-2 concise questions when user requests are vague or missing details, BEFORE commissioning Architect. Prevents wasted planning cycles.
- Strategist prompt updated: step 2 is now "If VAGUE → ask user, THEN WAIT. Do NOT proceed until clear."

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-17

### Breaking Changes
- **Removed ALL slash commands** — `/task`, `/auto`, `/plan`, `/status`, `/agents`, `/delegate`, `/retry`, `/abort`, `/version` deleted. Plugin is now fully automatic.
- **Primary agent reduced to ONE** — Only `strategist` is primary. Architect, Engineer, Auditor, Specialist are all subagents.
- **API changes**: `ConfigHandlerDeps` no longer accepts `commands` key. `createConfigHandler` no longer registers any commands.

### Added
- **Natural language mission detection** — Strategist reads user messages and auto-starts missions via heuristic keyword matching
- **Anti-stuck system** — 6 detectors: timeout, retry loop, circular deps, all-failed, stalled, resource-exhausted
- **Diagnostic Specialist** — Activated automatically when stuck. Categories: TOO_BIG, UNCLEAR_SPEC, ENV_ISSUE, MODEL_LIMIT, BUGGY_CODE, EXTERNAL_BLOCK
- **Loop counter** — Tracks same-error repetitions per task; stops brute-force at 3 failures
- **Stall watcher** — Monitors `lastProgressAt`; auto-escalates to Specialist after 10 minutes no progress
- **Dynamic worker throttling** — Drops from 3 to 1 worker when Ollama latency spikes detected
- **Event handler intercepts `message.created`** — No command framework needed
- **DOX Framework Integration** — Auto-init, auto-closeout, timestamped run records in `.opencode/DOX/`
- **Full agent field forwarding** — `model`, `fallbackModel`, `smallModel`, `temperature`, `topP`, `topK`, `maxTokens`, `description`, `prompt`, `systemPrompt`, `mode`, `color`, `tools`, `permission`, `skills`, `thinking`, `allowLoop`, `loopCount` all propagated from opencode.json
- **Built-in agent collision guard** — Auto-renames to `orchestrator-{name}` if user collides with core subagents
- **Compaction resilience** — All agent prompts instruct re-read from disk after compaction events

### Changed
- **Config handler**: Removed all command registration logic. Only agents + orchestrator settings remain.
- **Strategist prompt**: Rewritten for command-free automatic orchestration
- **Architect prompt**: Instructs to write per-project `.opencode/plans/{slug}/plan.md` and `.opencode/todo/{slug}.md`
- **Engineer prompt**: Token-efficient. Self-documenting code preferred. "If blocked after 2 attempts → report BLOCKED"
- **Auditor prompt**: Only activates for `critical-path: yes` tasks. Non-critical tasks skip verification.
- **Hard parallelism cap**: `maxParallelWorkers` clamped to `Math.min(userValue, 3)`. Cannot exceed 3 regardless of config.

### Fixed
- ESM output verified: zero `require()` calls in `dist/`

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **MissionController** — async state machine for fully automatic missions (`/auto` command)
- **Per-project directories** — plans in `.opencode/plans/{slug}/`, todos in `.opencode/todo/{slug}.md`
- **Session polling** and **file watching**
- **14 vitest tests**

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- Initial release with `/task`, `/plan`, `/agents`, `/status`, `/delegate`, `/retry`, `/abort` commands
- 5 agent roles: Strategist, Architect, Engineer, Auditor, Specialist
- Ollama provider hard lock
- Full config inheritance from opencode.json
